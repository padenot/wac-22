  # Why not JavaScript for DSP

  - C++/Rust/... is more ergonomic for DSP
  - Lots of high-quality reusable DSP code in native
  - No risk of Garbage Collection
  - Better control on memory layout
  - It _really_ is faster
  - Modern optimizing compilers are amazing
  - Unlocks the door to SIMD programming
  - Compiled Ahead-of-time and not Just-in-Time in tiers (always fast)
  - Predictable performance accross browsers

  ---

  # Somewhat recent WASM features

  - Relaxed SIMD, allowing non-determinist maths (nice for audio programming), pre-condition for an FMA instruction
  - Shared WASM memory
  - `wasm64` to have a heap bigger than 2<sup>32</sup> bytes

  ---

  # Caching computations vs. recomputing

  This needs to be measured each time: memory accesses are slow, but sometimes the cached
  result is very slow to compute.

  ---

  # Cheating is OK

  - How much resolution/precision do you need ?
  - Hybrid lookup table + interpolation ?
  - What is the input domain of your trigonometry functions anyways ?

  # Be good friends with the memory

  ---

  # Memory accesses often (but not always) dominate

  Fetching a **single** byte from memory is about 400 times slower than doing
  an addition. But you can't fetch a single byte, you can only fetch a complete
  line: pack your stuff neatly.

  CPU have caches, but caches are small, it best to fully utilize them. The bigger the cache size the slowest it is.

  Cache are organized in lines (64 bytes on x86 and regular ARM, 128 bytes on
  Apple Silicon)

  # Sequential and temporal locality

  Things that are accessed together should be together in memory:

  - filter coefficients
  - other algorithm state
  - planar vs. interleaved audio
  - multi-channel processing
  - **You name it, it's all memory!**

  ---

  # KISS

  **Always use arrays, never ever a linked list or anything else fancy\*, keep
  it simple and stupid most of the time.**

  <small>
  \* applies almost always, you will know when not to respect this rule, terms
  and condition apply.

  # Reduce working set size

  - Caches have a finite size
  - The faster they are, the smaller they are
  - You really really _really_ want to maximize their utilization
  - Don't waste memory, choose the right types, pack your structs

  [The Lost Art of Structure Packing](http://www.catb.org/esr/structure-packing/)

  # Speed of memory copies

  Rule of thumb on x86, DDR4: roughly 1ms per megabyte when caches aren't hot
  (often when fetching audio assets), for multi-megabyte copies.

  Obscenely fast on Apple Silicon compared to x86, still very slow.

  It trash caches, schedule copies in a smart way.

  Stagger/delay memory copies if they are really needed, but not right now.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è shared memory with the GPU !

  ---

  # Pay attention to the big picture

  Heavy memory operations on the device slow down **everything**, the memory
  bus is a shared resources.

  The GPU frequently shares the memory with the CPU, and has high bandwidth
  requirements.

  # Communication

  Try to limit `postMessage(...)` usage while audio is rendering, it _really_ matters.

  Shameless plug for [`ringbuf.js`](https://github.com/padenot/ringbuf.js), the
  simple single-consumer / single-producer ring buffer for JavaScript that
  solves all your problems‚Ñ¢.

  It's only an `npm install` and a couple HTTP headers away!

  # What to avoid in JS glue

  A bit of JavaScript glue code is, for now, unavoidable.

  Avoid anything that can GC and any fancy construct and it will be mostly OK,
  just KISS, no framework, no nothing.

  [Eye-opening (at least to me) for-loop style benchmark](forloops.html)

  Don't drop references if you can help it.

  It's _probably_ not the end of the world, modern garbage collectors are really
  good, it's always better if they don't run.

  # Increase latency to increase throughput

  Not all applications need the smallest audio latency

  Increase the output latency, get free performance gains (caches!)

  ```js
  (new AudioContext({latencyHint: "playback"})).outputLatency
  ```
  72ms

  ```js
  (new AudioContext({latencyHint: "interactive"})).outputLatency
  ```
  32ms

  # ... but always verify

  # You can't say you've optimized if you haven't measured

  Modern systems are too complex to reason about, measuring is the only way to be sure.

  It turns out it's also _extremely_ easy.

  Stop guessing, start measuring!
